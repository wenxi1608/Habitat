# Habitat

Habitat is an app that allows landlords, tenants and property agents to view the market rates for rental properties in Singapore. The app draws on data made available by URA based on rental contracts of private residential properties. User will need to select the year, quarter and district to view the average monthly rental rate ranging by the size of the property.

## Approach

1. Create a form using Bootstrap with the desired fields (i.e. year, quarter, district)
2. Use async function to call data based on user input
3. Pass the data into a column chart (for this app, the Google Charts charts library was used)
